    "Composition is a design pattern in OOPs that allows an object to reuse properties and behaviour from another object, rather than inheriting from the base class. It means created an instance of parents as the attribute of the child class.\n",

    "Bound method is a type of object that represents a method of an instance of class, rather than from the class itself. Bound methods are useful when where we need to pass a method as fucntion to another fucntion or to store it for later use."
