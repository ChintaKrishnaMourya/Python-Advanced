    "### Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "OOPs helps us to write the code in organised way. Benefits are :\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Abstraction\" - Hides the implementation inside the classes from the user and only show the functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Reusability \" - We can create new objects by defining classes with similar properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Polymorphism\" - Objects of different classes can respond to same method,.It allows more flexible implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Inheritence\" - Classes can inherit properties from parent class, this allows the reusability of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Encapsulation\" - It wraps data and methods that wor on data within one unit. This restricts accessing of variables & methods directly and prevents accidental modification."

It refers to instance of class being referred to.By using self, we can access the attributes and methods of the class. \"Self\" makes it possible to create multiple instances of class with different states.\n"
