    "\n",
    "Abstract superclass is the blueprint for other classes. But it is instantiated directly as an object. It allows to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes.\n",

    "\n",
    "When a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statment, it creates an attribute of the class. A class variable is a variable associated with a class as a whole, rather than with individual instances of the class. That means it is defined outside the __ int__ method."

    "\n",
